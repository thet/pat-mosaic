# pat-mosaic

A [Patternslib](http://patternslib.com) pattern.

Layout pattern which does a masonry like layout, popularized by David Desandro and his Masonry libaray ( https://masonry.desandro.com/ - Kudos to him!).

This one is based on CSS layout and some minimal JavaScript to set the height of the container properly.
