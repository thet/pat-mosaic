    <p>It's already mutated into human form, shoot it. Oh Mom, there's nothing wrong with calling a boy. Not a word, not a word, not a word now. Quiet, uh, donations, you want me to make a donation to the coast guard youth auxiliary? Whoa, they really cleaned this place up, looks brand new. Hello, hello, anybody home? Think, McFly, think. I gotta have time to get them re-typed. Do you realize what would happen if I hand in my reports in your handwriting. I'll get fired. You wouldn't want that to happen would you? Would you?</p>
    <p>Look, George, I'm telling you George, if you do not ask Lorraine to that dance, I'm gonna regret it for the rest of my life. Look, I'm just not ready to ask Lorraine out to the dance, and not you, nor anybody else on this planet is gonna make me change my mind. Right. Marty, you're acting like you haven't seen me in a week. I'll get it back to you, alright?</p>
    <p>Doc, Doc, it's me, Marty. Now that's a risk you'll have to take you're life depends on it. Doc, she's beautiful. She's crazy about me. Look at this, look what she wrote me, Doc. That says it all. Doc, you're my only hope. Ah, where're my pants? Marty, such a nice name.</p>
